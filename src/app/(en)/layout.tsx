/**
 * ROOT LAYOUT #1 — English. Serves the BARE paths: `/`, `/product`, `/security`, …
 *
 * `(en)` is a route GROUP: parentheses mean the folder contributes nothing to the URL. That is
 * the whole trick, and it is why the English URLs are byte-identical to what they were before
 * Hebrew existed — no middleware, no rewrite, no redirect, no `next.config.ts` change.
 *
 * THERE ARE TWO ROOT LAYOUTS IN THIS APP, this one and src/app/he/layout.tsx, and
 * src/app/layout.tsx is deliberately GONE. Consequences worth knowing before editing:
 *
 *   · `lang` and `dir` are resolved at BUILD time per locale rather than branched on a param.
 *     For the RTL work that is strictly better: nothing has to read a request to know which
 *     direction it is rendering.
 *   · Navigating between `/product` and `/he/product` crosses a root-layout boundary, so Next
 *     does a full document load. That is correct here, not a cost: `<html dir>` flips across
 *     that boundary, so a client-side transition would crossfade an LTR snapshot into an RTL
 *     live frame — a full-width horizontal jump of every line on the page — and a hard load
 *     rebuilds every GSAP timeline from zero, which is what lets `useDirSign()` be treated as
 *     stable for a mount's lifetime. (This used to cite `LocaleToggle.tsx`, which carried the
 *     reasoning; that component was deleted 2026-08-16 with the nav's locale switch, so the
 *     argument is restated here rather than lost.)
 *   · ⚠️ NEVER ADD `src/app/not-found.tsx`. With no root layout at `src/app/`, Next injects its
 *     own built-in layout for `/_not-found`; adding a custom one makes the file a non-builtin
 *     page, the injection stops, and the build EXITS 1 with "doesn't have a root layout". A
 *     per-locale `not-found.tsx` INSIDE `(en)/` or `he/` is fine and is what you want anyway.
 *   · `src/app/api/`, `favicon.ico`, `icon.png` and `apple-icon.png` stay at the app root and
 *     need no layout — they are app-route/metadata routes and short-circuit the root-layout
 *     check. `/api/models` is never localized.

/* ⚠️ REWRITTEN 2026-08-18. WHAT WAS HERE WAS THE CLONE TARGET'S POSITIONING WITH CLIX'S NAME
   IN IT: "Clix is the trusted AI partner to the world's leading financial institutions." That
   is rogo's business, not clix's — clix builds automation for Israeli SMBs — and it was live on
   every English page and served to Google as this company's description of itself.

   It surfaced while chasing a stale favicon in search results. The recrawl that fixes the icon
   republishes the description in the same pass, so shipping this FIRST is the whole point: a
   fresh crawl of the old text would have been worse than the stale-but-accurate snippet Google
   was already showing.

   The title stays lowercase "clix" as the site's own name — the previous note's reasoning holds
   and is kept below — but it is now a TEMPLATE, so a tab reads "Product · clix" rather than an
   undifferentiated "clix" on all ten routes. `default` is what the home page and any route
   without its own title get.

   ⚠️ THE DESCRIPTION IS SOURCED, NOT AUTHORED. It restates this site's own hero
   (`en/home.ts`: "You bring the business. / We bring the intelligence.") and its four service
   cards — AI agents, WhatsApp, CRM, integrations. Nothing here is a claim the site does not
   already make about itself, which is the standing rule for this repo's copy.

   PREVIOUS NOTE, still true of the title: deliberately "clix", not the target's own — this is
   the one place the build identifies as itself rather than as the clone target, and a tab
   reading "Rogo" would misrepresent whose site it is. */
