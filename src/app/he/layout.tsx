/**
 * ROOT LAYOUT #2 — Hebrew, RTL. Serves `/he`, `/he/product`, `/he/security`, …
 *
 * `he` is a REAL path segment, not a group, so no `(he)` wrapper is needed — the URL is legible
 * straight from the folder tree. See src/app/(en)/layout.tsx for why there are two root layouts
 * and what that implies.
 *
 * ⚠️ `dir="rtl"` IS SET HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. Do not set `dir` on any other element, and do not
 * read `document.dir` or `document.documentElement.lang` to discover it — client components take
 * direction from `useDirection()`/`useDirSign()`, server components from `getDirection()`. A DOM
 * sniff has no server snapshot, so it would render the LTR branch on the server and visibly flip
 * on hydration.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is a genuine bug this attribute would otherwise cause:
 * `direction` inherits into SVG, where `text-anchor: start` means INLINE-start. ClixFelixFooter
 * draws its wordmark as raw `<text x="-20">` with the default anchor, so under `dir="rtl"` the
 * anchor moves to the right edge and the 2034-unit-wide word is positioned entirely outside its
 * viewBox — it vanishes. That component pins `direction="ltr"` on the `<text>` for that reason,
 * not for styling.
 *
 * TYPE. The sitewide face `Discovery` (public/fonts/discovery/discovery-var.woff2) carries
 * COMPLETE Hebrew coverage — verified with fontTools, not assumed: all 27 base and final letters,
 * the full niqqud set, maqaf, geresh, gershayim, sof pasuq, and the shekel sign, across a
 * `wght 100–800` variable axis. So no font is vendored for this locale. ⚠️ But `--font-sans` and
 * `--font-display` fall back to `"Inter", sans-serif` and the vendored Inter subsets carry NO
 * U+0590–U+05FF, so Hebrew's only fallback is the OS `sans-serif` — a different family with
 * different metrics than anything here was measured against. Chosen rather than inherited; see
 * features/i18n-rtl/FEATURE.md.

/* The Hebrew description is SOURCED, not translated: its closing clause is the real company
   site's own positioning line (docs/reference/clixsolutions/, services H1, recovered from
   pages/*.html rather than content.json — see he/chrome.ts for why the H1s in that file lost
   their spaces).

   ⚠️ EXTENDED 2026-08-18, NOT REPLACED. The sourced line alone names no product, so a search
   result for it told a reader nothing about what clix sells. The three services now leading the
   sentence are also sourced — they are clix's own service names from the live site
   (מערכות CRM, סוכני AI לוואטסאפ, אוטומציות לייעול עסקי) and match the four service cards in he/home.ts.

   The English side had no such excuse and was rewritten outright: it carried rogo's claim about
   "the world's leading financial institutions". See (en)/layout.tsx.

   ⚠️ NO DASHES, per the standing 2026-08-10 instruction on clix prose. The title separator is a
   pipe, which is also what the live clix site uses ("CLIX | אוטומציות חכמות לעסקים"). */
