/**
 * contactRules — the client-side validation and send path shared by the site's two contact
 * forms: the full one on /contact (ContactForm.tsx) and the compact one in the footer's closing
 * band (FooterContactForm.tsx).
 *
 * Extracted from ContactForm.tsx on 2026-09-22, when the second form arrived. Before that the
 * rules lived in exactly two places — that file and the API route — and a footer form with its
 * own copy would have made it three, the one arrangement the duplication note below exists to
 * prevent. Moving them changed no behaviour on /contact.
 *
 * ⚠️ VALIDATION IS STILL DUPLICATED ACROSS THE NETWORK, AND MUST BE. The same bounds and patterns
 * live in src/app/api/contact/route.ts. The client copy exists so a typo does not cost a round
 * trip; the server copy exists because the client copy is unenforceable. If a bound changes,
 * change both — the API is the one that counts.
 *
 * Plain module, no JSX and no hooks, so both forms can call it from event handlers.
