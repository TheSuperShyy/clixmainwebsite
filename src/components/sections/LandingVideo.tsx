/**
 * LandingVideo — the 16:9 clip that sits under the testimonials on /.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A DELIBERATE COPY OF ClixVideo's TREATMENT, not a shared component. The user's
 * ask (2026-08-18) was "make it just like the hero video from clix section", so the frame is
 * /clix's measured one: aspect-ratio 1.77778, radius 6px, filled with `object-cover`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE MUTE TOGGLE IS BACK, AND IT CAME BACK WITH THE AUDIO (2026-08-19). History, because
 * it reversed twice: the toggle shipped with the section, was removed on 2026-08-18 (user:
 * "remove this", against a screenshot) — at which point `muted` became a hard attribute and
 * this header said "if the clip's audio is ever wanted, the toggle comes back WITH it". Then
 * the user re-exported landing-vid.mp4 with an AAC track and asked for sound. So this is that
 * clause being exercised, not the 08-18 decision being forgotten: audio-with-no-control would
 * be sound the reader cannot stop, and the browser would block the observer's play() besides.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT STILL STARTS MUTED, AND MUST. The IntersectionObserver below calls play() with no user
 * gesture behind it — scrolling is not a gesture — and every engine's autoplay policy allows
 * that only for a muted element. Initial `muted=false` would reject the play() on every scroll
 * into view and the clip would sit on its poster. Unmuting is the click on the toggle, which
 * IS the gesture that authorises audio. The toggle is ClixVideo's verbatim — geometry, glyph,
 * logical-property RTL notes and all — and reads `home.video.{unmute,mute}`, restored to both
 * locale files (one namespace per route, so it cannot read clix's copy).
 *
 * ⚠️ SCROLLING AWAY PAUSES SOUND BUT DOES NOT RESET THE CHOICE. The observer pauses the
 * element off-screen, audio included, and playback resumes where it left off with the mute
 * state the visitor chose. Muting again on exit would override an explicit choice; not
 * pausing would be a soundtrack from a section you cannot see.
 *
 * It is a SEPARATE FILE rather than an import of ClixVideo because the two differ in the
 * things a section owns: the source, the surrounding padding (this one sits between two
 * `bg-canvas` home sections, /clix's floats over ClixBackdrop), and now the controls. Sharing
 * would have meant a prop for each — more coupling than the ~40 lines it saves.
 *
 * PADDING is the home page's rhythm, not /clix's: Testimonials closes on pb-32 / pb-20
 * (desktop) and WhyRogo opens on pt-20 / pt-24, so this section carries the SMALL half of
 * each gap — py-10 phone, py-20 from 810 — and the two neighbours supply the rest. Copying
 * /clix's pt-32 here would have stacked 196px of air under the testimonial heading.
 *
 * `landing-vid-poster.jpg` is frame 0 of the mp4 (ffmpeg `select=eq(n,0)`), so the poster and
 * the first painted frame are the same image and there is no visible swap when the clip
 * starts. Same trick as clix-demo-poster.jpg.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ONLY PLAYS WHILE IT IS ON SCREEN (user's call, 2026-08-18), AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO
 * `autoPlay` ATTRIBUTE. An IntersectionObserver owns playback end to end: `autoPlay` would have
 * started the clip during hydration — this section sits below the fold on every tier — and the
 * observer would then have had to stop something that should never have started, wasting a
 * 1.4MB fetch on visitors who never scroll this far. The observer's first callback fires on
 * observe(), so "visible on load" takes the same code path as every later case; there is no
 * separate initial-state branch.
 *
 * THE 25% THRESHOLD IS A DECISION, not a measurement — a sliver of a 16:9 box at the very
 * bottom of the viewport is not "on screen" in the sense the ask meant. Playing starts when a
 * quarter of the frame is in view and stops when it is not; one number, both directions, so
 * there is no hysteresis band to reason about.
 *
 * The clip is 1920×1080, 25.5s, 1.4MB — re-exported 2026-08-19 with an AAC audio track (and a
 * smaller video bitrate; it was 3.5MB silent). Probed with ffprobe, not assumed.
