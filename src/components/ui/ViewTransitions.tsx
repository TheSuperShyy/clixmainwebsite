/**
 * ViewTransitions — drives a real crossfade between routes.
 *
 * WHY THIS REPLACED THE FADE (2026-08-12). The first attempt was an opacity keyframe on
 * `template.tsx`: the incoming page animated `opacity: 0 -> 1`. **That is a white flash by
 * construction, and the user saw it immediately.** At `opacity: 0` there is no previous page
 * left to see — App Router has already unmounted it — so what shows through is `body`'s own
 * `--color-paper`. The page did not fade *from the last page*, it faded *up from white*. It
 * was worse than no animation at all, which at least swapped instantly.
 *
 * A fade cannot fix this. Nothing rendered by React can, because the thing that has to stay
 * on screen — the outgoing page — no longer exists in the tree by the time the new one paints.
 * The old frame has to be held by something outside React. That is exactly what the View
 * Transitions API does: the browser snapshots the current document, lets the DOM change, then
 * crossfades snapshot to live. Both frames are on screen at once, so no background is ever
 * exposed and there is no flash.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY NOT `experimental.viewTransition`. Next 16.2.12 does carry the flag, but it routes
 * through React's `ViewTransition` component, and React 19.2.4 stable does not export one —
 * it ships on the experimental channel. Rather than move the app to a React canary for this,
 * this calls `document.startViewTransition` directly. The browser API is stable and typed in
 * the DOM lib already; only React's binding to it is not.
 *
 * THE AWKWARD PART, and why the promise dance below exists. `startViewTransition(cb)` snapshots,
 * runs `cb`, and crossfades once the DOM has updated — it assumes `cb` updates the DOM
 * synchronously. `router.push()` does not; it kicks off an async render. So `cb` returns a
 * promise that is resolved by a `usePathname()` effect once the new route has actually
 * committed. Resolving early would end the snapshot before the new page paints and reintroduce
 * the flash this whole file exists to remove.
 *
 * SAFETY VALVE: if the navigation never commits (a failed route, an aborted push), the promise
 * would never resolve and the browser would sit on a frozen snapshot until its own ~4s timeout.
 * The 1500ms fallback resolves it first. It is deliberately far longer than the 300ms
 * animation, so it can only ever fire on a genuine failure, never on a slow-but-working nav.
 *
 * FALLBACK: browsers without the API, and anyone on `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, get a
 * plain `router.push`. That is an instant swap with no flash — the correct degradation, since
 * the flash was the bug and the crossfade is the enhancement.
 *
 * THE HASH LANDING (2026-08-13). Nav's "Customers" points at `/#testimonials`. From any other
 * route that is a real navigation, so it comes through here — and it arrived at the top of the
 * home page instead of at the section. The cause is `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` in
 * globals.css. Next's own hash scroll (`ScrollAndFocusHandler` in layout-router) wraps its
 * `scrollIntoView()` in `disableSmoothScrollDuringRouteTransition`, but that helper only
 * neutralises smooth scrolling when `<html>` carries `data-scroll-behavior="smooth"` — and even
 * with the attribute the hash branch returns before Next forces the reflow Chrome needs to pick
 * the change up. So the scroll starts as a 1-2s ANIMATION, from the old page's offset, at the
 * exact moment the browser is about to capture the post-update snapshot. The capture lands on
 * frame one of that animation — the top of the page — and the crossfade paints it over the live
 * document. The scroll is not missing; it is a slow scroll whose first frame got photographed.
 *
 * So the hash is landed HERE instead, explicitly and instantly:
 *
 *   · `behavior: "instant"` rather than toggling `style.scrollBehavior` — it overrides the CSS
 *     rule per-call with no reflow dance, which is the failure mode above.
 *   · in the pathname effect, i.e. AFTER the new route has committed (child effects run before
 *     parent ones, so Next's own attempt has already happened and ours supersedes it) and
 *     BEFORE `resolve()`, so the snapshot the browser takes is of the page already at the
 *     section. Resolving first would photograph the top of the page again.
 *   · same-page hashes never reach this file — AppLink returns early for them — so ordinary
 *     in-page anchors keep the smooth scroll `globals.css` asks for. Only the cross-route
 *     landing is instant, which is right: a route change should arrive, not travel.
