/**
 * English copy for /. OWNED BY ONE AGENT — see features/i18n-rtl/FEATURE.md.
 *
 * THE NAMESPACE'S SHAPE IS DEFINED HERE, in the English file, and `dictionary.ts` only imports
 * it. That is what keeps this a single-owner file: growing the namespace never means editing a
 * file another agent also touches.
 *
 * ⚠️ EXTRACT VERBATIM. Every string moved here must be byte-identical to what the component
 * said before, including curly apostrophes (’ U+2019) and any em dash. The English render is
 * verified as a no-op, so a "tidied" string is a regression.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO JSX, NO HTML, NO MARKUP. Where a `<br>` or an inner `<span>` IS a colour boundary, the
 * element stays in the component and the two runs come here as separately-named keys.
 *
 * ARRAY TYPING, and it matters: use a fixed-length TUPLE where the count is layout (a grid's
 * cells, a nav's slots), and `readonly string[]` where the count is how the language happens to
 * WRAP. Pinning the second kind forbids the divergence Hebrew needs; leaving the first kind
 * loose lets a layout break through.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE REPEATING SETS ARE OBJECTS KEYED BY id, NOT ARRAYS ───────────────────────────
 * Five tenants, three stats, five badges and six testimonial cards all repeat. None of them is
 * an array here, because an array — even a tuple — only checks the COUNT. Every one of these
 * sets is already declared in its component as a table of MEASURED GEOMETRY keyed by `id`
 * (`iconBox`, `titleMax`, `bodyTracking`, `labelWidth`, `border`, `numberCellPhone`), and the
 * copy has to line up with the right row of that table, not merely be the right length. So the
 * component keeps its geometry table, the dictionary keys the copy by the same `id`, and each
 * component derives its id union from THIS type (`keyof HomeDict["whyRogo"]["tenants"]`).
 * Renaming or dropping an id then fails the build in the component, and a Hebrew file missing
 * one key fails it in `Translated<>`. A tuple would have caught neither.
 *
 * ─── THE THREE STAT VALUES ARE IN HERE, AND THEY DO NOT TRANSLATE ─────────────────────────
 * `200+` · `2×` · `24/6` stay Latin digits in every locale. They live in the dictionary anyway,
 * because they are rendered text and one of them is also an `aria-label` — the same call the
 * repo already makes for `chrome.footer.copyrightYear` ("© 2026") and `copyrightHolder`
 * ("clix"). LogoCarousel's thirteen tool names go the other way and stay in the component:
 * those are trademarks paired 1:1 with an icon slug, i.e. structural data, not copy.
 */

/**
 * A stat label's second half. Typed WIDE on purpose — `as const` would infer the literal type
 * `null` from row 1 and then `Translated<>` would pass it through unwidened, forbidding Hebrew
 * from breaking a label English does not break. Line splitting is the language's business
 * (contract §3), so the type has to allow either.

     * The six client quotes, in `CLIP_IDS` order, read by `sections/QuoteCarousel.tsx`.
     *
     * ⚠️⚠️ THESE ARE TRANSLATIONS, AND THEY ARE THE ONLY STRINGS ON THIS PAGE THAT ARE NEITHER
     * THE CLIENT'S WORDS NOR SOURCED FROM ANYWHERE.
     *
     * Every one of these six clients spoke HEBREW. The user supplied their wording on
     * 2026-08-13 (`quote.md`, repo root) and `he/home.ts` carries it verbatim — that file is
     * the source of truth for what was actually said. What sits below is a faithful English
     * rendering written in-repo, because the English page needs one.
     *
     * So the usual direction of this file is INVERTED here. Everywhere else the English is
     * authored and the Hebrew is a translation of it; in this one block the Hebrew is the
     * original. If a client supplies their own English wording, it replaces the string below
     * and the Hebrew does not change.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE QUOTES ARE ALSO THE SWITCH. `sections/Testimonials.tsx` decides between the video
     * accordion and this carousel by testing whether all six are non-empty — a render flag
     * could not do that job, because `PageDictProvider` serialises this whole namespace into
     * the RSC payload and an unrendered string still ships. **Emptying any one of these six
     * silently reverts the landing page to the accordion.** That is the intended failure mode,
     * not a bug; read the block above `CLIP_IDS` there before changing it.
     *
     * ⚠️ LENGTH IS LAYOUT. `SLIDE_STYLE.quoteDesktop` in QuoteCarousel.tsx sets a per-slide font
     * size fitted to these character counts — 207 / 289 / 174 / 189 / 267 / 140 as shipped, with
     * the two past ~260 taking 32px and the rest 36px. English is the binding case at both sizes
     * (Hebrew is shorter in every slot). Re-measure, do not re-count, if any of these change.
