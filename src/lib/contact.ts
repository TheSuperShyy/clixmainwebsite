/**
 * The company's real contact details, in ONE place.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-08-13). These four values lived as a `CONTACT` const inside
 * Footer.tsx. That was fine while the footer was the only thing that knew them; it stopped
 * being fine when /contact grew an aside that lists the same four. Two copies of a phone
 * number drift, and the drift is silent — nothing type-checks a string against another
 * string in a different file.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE EMAIL CHANGED WHEN IT MOVED. Footer.tsx carried `info@clixsolution.com`, without
 * the hyphen, which is what docs/reference/clixsolutions/ prints on the real site. The user
 * confirmed on 2026-08-13 that the hyphenated `info@clix-solution.com` is the live inbox and
 * that the reference capture is stale. So the footer's mailto changes as a side effect of
 * this extraction, deliberately and with permission — it is not a typo introduced here.
 * The form's recipient is the same address; see src/app/api/contact/route.ts.
 *
 * These are LINK TARGETS and identifiers, not copy. They are not translated and no key for
 * them exists in the dictionaries — an email address is the same string in every locale.
 * The LABELS beside them ("Email", "אימייל") are copy and do live in the dictionary.
